 * What kind of data structure does this return? Good to put that into a comment.

 * I don't think you could make this into one database query, as you do need to join two things:
 * requests.assigned_user_id and requests.user_id both need to be joined to the users table.
 * 
 * Sometimes when SQL starts to get hairy it's reasonable to move the logic into code. But I think this is fine.
